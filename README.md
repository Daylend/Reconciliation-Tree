### App Concept

This app responds to the Reconciliation Tree initiative by allowing the user to holistically interact with a map of the University of Lethbridge campus to locate themselves relative to the locations of the Reconciliation Trees that are planted, as well as other significant sculptures on the Reconciliation Map. The interactive map allows the user to track their location and select hotspots on the map that they are curious about. There are large hotspots to represent the Reconciliation Trees that are planted, including a Saskatoon Berry Bush, Sargent Poplar, Golden Willow, and Lodgepole Pine. The smaller hotspots will represent the various sculptures around campus.
When a Reconciliation Tree hotspot is selected, a card will appear showing a 3D model of the plant, which the user will be able to rotate or zoom in/out on. Included will be a description of the plant according to Western interpretation, and the user will be able to flip the card in order to reveal the Blackfoot significance.
When a smaller hotspot is selected, a pop-up will appear with photos of the significant sculpture that is in that indicated spot. A description will accompany the photo.

### Design Description

The design is inspired by Southern Alberta Blackfoot landscapes, as well as the interconnectivity that exists between the U of L campus and the Blackfoot community. For example, the map will appear to be contemporary Google Map, however it will use colours that are significant to the Blackfoot people and the University of Lethbridge. When the cards appear, a background photo of an Alberta landscape will be featured. Both pictures were taken just outside Waterton Lakes National Park, a site of historical significance to both Blackfoot and Western communities. A blue or gold overlay will be applied over each photo, and then the card will be displayed overtop. In summary, the design will be largely realist with contemporary interactive applications of 3D models and Maps, while considering colours that are significant to the communities involved.

### Technologies Used

Prototypes and final images were created using Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and InVision. GitHub was utilized as a collaboration platform between group members. Brackets was used for the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Framework 7 animation was used to simulate the card flips. AR.JS was utilized to facilitate AR programming. Google Maps was used to create the map and simulate location tracking. 3D graphics were made with Blender.
