						<p>Cottonwood Trees grow in the river plains where we live. Elder Pete Standing Alone explained that for Cottonwood seeds to grow, a river needs to flood.In times past, the branches of the Cottonwood were used as the burial places of our people and are still considered sacred trees. Elder Pete Standing Alone reminded us that our ceremonial lodges often have at their centre, a poplar tree. It is an important symbol for our people of the connection between the spirit world and our physical body. We have special rituals that help us find and bring this tree to the Sundance. Its branches make the lodge roof.</p>
