					<p>The Saskatoon plant gives us food to eat, medicine and wood for building things.The berries are really good just picked but you can also dry them and store them. When the berries are dried, you can boil them in water with a bit of fat and make a soup with it. Soup made from this berry is served at ceremonies and was a staple used year round.The Saskatoon plant is an important symbol in many of our ceremonies. Sometimes its branches and roots are mixed with tobacco to smoke for praying.
