                            <p>This app was developed in partnership between the Agility Program, students of the Department of New Media of the University of Lethbridge, and the Southern Alberta Blackfoot community.
                                The University of Lethbridge main campus is situated in Treaty 7 Blackfoot Territory. <br>
                                <br> In recognizing the lives lost and survivors of Residential Schools in Southern Alberta, a student-led initiative Reconciliation Tree Planting Ceremony is being held on March 27, 2020 to bring the community together to heal and reconcile. The trees being planted honor the Blackfoot peopleâ€™s experience in past, present, and future. Students will speak to the project and Elders will share personal stories.
                                This app was developed by New Media students to enable deeper interaction through contemporary technology and understanding of the trees and other significant campus landmarks for all who participate in the ceremony.
